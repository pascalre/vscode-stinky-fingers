# vscode-stinky-fingers README
This VS Code plugin will jerk your colleagues around. You can install this plugin at your colleagues computer and see what happens.

## Features
Everytime a letter is typed, the plugin performs a check, whether the letter has to be replaced. In this case, the letter will be replaced by an other random one. If the random letter is typed, it will be replaced the next time as well. After a couple of replacements you won't be able to type anything. A standard text will be printed such as the lyrics of Madonna's Hung Up.
