# Stinky Fingers
This Visual Studio Code plugin will jerk your colleagues around. You can install this plugin at your colleagues computer and see what happens. ðŸ˜œ

## Features
This plugin will replace some letters which the user types. The first replaced letter is 'e' which will be replaced by the letter 's'. Let's say the user types "Hello", which will change to "Hsllo". The next letter which will be replaced is 's', it will change to a random letter. This will go on until ten different letters will have an alternative letter to be changed to.

When this happens, the user has no control about his keyboard anymore and every letter he write will print a letter of the blame text "DUDE YOU REALLY HAVE STINKY FINGERS! WANT TO WRITE SOME LYRICS BY MADONNA?" followed by the lyrics of Madonna's Hung Up.
